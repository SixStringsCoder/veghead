## VegHead

### Introduction

**VegHead**, is a single-page React app using Yelp's API to connect a user with the *best matched* and *highest rated* restaurants in a city or location (e.g. NE Portland) chosen by the user.

This app was originally part of a React course at Code Academy but is refactored and personalized here as "VegHead".
