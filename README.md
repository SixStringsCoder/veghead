## VegHead

### Introduction

**VegHead**, is a single-page React app using Yelp's API to connect a user with the *best matched*, *highest rated*, *Most Reviewed* restaurants in a city or location (e.g. NE Portland) chosen by the user.

The page loads with default vegetarian restaurants with *Most Reviews* settings.

This app was originally part of a React course at Code Academy but is refactored and personalized here as "VegHead".
